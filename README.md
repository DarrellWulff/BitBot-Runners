# BitBot Runners
## An Endless Runner Game
### Made With C# In Unity
#### by Darrell Wulff

A game a made with C# in 2016, features a procedurally generated pixel art world that loops endlessly. This was my first released full finished game, but I have improved greatly since then so the code examples here are not even close to the standards I have now. It was a great learning experience for me to stick to a project and see it through. You hold you android phone landscape and it is split into two sides or buttons. Touch or hold the left side and you jump with your jetpack and touch the right side you can launch a bit beam. I ended up remaking the project using 3D voxel graphics, ensuring it reached the real vision I had for this difficult little endless runner game!

# The remake of this game I released in 2019 can be found on the play store
