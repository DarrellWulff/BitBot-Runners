# BitBot Runners
## An Endless Runner Game
### Made With C# In Unity
#### by Darrell Wulff

A game a made with C# in 2016, features an endless procedurally generate pixel art world that loops endlessly. This was my first released full finished game, but I have improved greatly since then so the code examples here are not even close to the standards I have now. It was a great learning experience for me to stick to a porject and see it through. I ended up remaking the porject using 3D voxel graphics and ensuring it reached the real vision I had for this difficult little endless runner game!

# The remake of this game I released in 2019 can be found on the play store
